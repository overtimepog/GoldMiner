# AI-Powered Startup Idea Generation and Validation System MVP - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
Build an MVP of an AI-powered autonomous startup idea generation and validation system using multi-agent architecture, OpenRouter's free AI models, and proven validation frameworks to create an intelligent platform for generating, researching, and validating startup concepts with real-world data.

## Core Value Proposition
- Autonomous Operation: Generate and validate startup ideas with minimal human intervention
- Real-Time Market Intelligence: Leverage current market data for accurate validation
- Cost-Effective: Built entirely on free AI models and open-source frameworks
- Scalable Architecture: Multi-agent system capable of processing multiple ideas simultaneously

## Technology Stack
- Core Framework: Python 3.9+
- Web Framework: FastAPI for REST APIs
- Frontend Interface: Streamlit for rapid prototyping and user interface
- AI Model Access: OpenRouter API with free models
- Agent Framework: LangChain for multi-agent orchestration
- Data Storage: SQLite for MVP, PostgreSQL for production scaling
- Deployment: Docker containers with FastAPI + Streamlit

## Free AI Models Configuration
Primary Models:
- google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free - Main reasoning and analysis engine
- meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free - Idea generation and creative tasks
- google/gemini-flash-1.5-8b:free - Real-time data processing and validation

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Idea Generation Engine
- Framework: LangChain agents with OpenRouter integration
- Input Sources: Market trends, customer pain points, industry reports
- Output: Structured startup concept with problem statement, solution outline, and target market
- API Endpoint: POST /api/generate-ideas

### 2. Market Research Automation
- Web scraping for competitor analysis
- Social media sentiment analysis
- Industry report aggregation
- Patent and IP monitoring
- Tech Stack: BeautifulSoup + Selenium for scraping, Pandas for data analysis

### 3. Validation Framework Implementation
Validation Criteria:
- Problem validation (25% weight)
- Solution validation (25% weight)
- Market validation (30% weight)
- Execution validation (20% weight)

### 4. User Interface Components
Streamlit Dashboard:
- Idea Generation Panel: Input parameters and generate new concepts
- Validation Dashboard: Real-time validation scoring and metrics
- Market Intelligence: Competitive landscape and market analysis
- Export Features: PDF reports and CSV data exports

## Multi-Agent Architecture
Three Core Agents:
1. Idea Generator Agent: Generate novel startup concepts using market gap analysis
2. Market Researcher Agent: Conduct comprehensive market research and competitive analysis
3. Validator Agent: Apply validation frameworks and scoring mechanisms

## Data Storage Schema
SQLite Database:
- startup_ideas table: Store generated ideas with metadata
- validation_results table: Store validation scores and details
- market_research table: Store competitor analysis and market data

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- FastAPI backend setup with OpenRouter integration
- Basic Streamlit interface for idea input
- Single-agent idea generation using free LLaMA model
- SQLite database schema implementation

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Implementation (Weeks 3-4)
- LangChain multi-agent system with specialized roles
- Market research automation using web scraping
- Validation framework integration with scoring algorithms
- Enhanced Streamlit dashboard with real-time updates

### Phase 3: Intelligence Enhancement (Weeks 5-6)
- Automated competitive analysis capabilities
- Financial modeling and projection features
- PDF report generation with professional formatting
- Advanced filtering and search functionality

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (Weeks 7-8)
- Comprehensive testing suite and validation
- Performance optimization for concurrent processing
- Documentation and deployment guides
- Beta user feedback integration

## Success Metrics
- Idea Generation Speed: < 30 seconds per concept
- Validation Completeness: 95%+ of validation criteria populated
- System Uptime: 99%+ availability during testing phase
- API Response Time: < 2 seconds for standard requests
- Zero AI Model Costs: 100% usage of free OpenRouter models

## Risk Mitigation
- Rate limiting handling for free models with intelligent queuing
- Multi-source validation to prevent AI hallucination
- Ethical web scraping with robots.txt compliance
- Clear communication of validation limitations

## Deployment Strategy
- Hosting: Railway, Render, or similar free-tier platforms
- Database: SQLite for MVP with migration path to PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Streamlit Community Cloud for free hosting
- API: FastAPI deployed on containerized platform

## Technical Implementation Requirements
1. OpenRouter API integration with free model configuration
2. FastAPI backend with async request handling
3. LangChain multi-agent orchestration system
4. Streamlit dashboard with interactive components
5. SQLite database with migration-ready schema
6. Web scraping tools with rate limiting
7. Validation scoring algorithm implementation
8. Export functionality for reports (PDF, CSV)
9. Error handling and logging system
10. Docker containerization for deployment
